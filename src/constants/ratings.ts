  `For my first time in a restaurant of it's style it was
    amazing I feel it's a great way to get a taste of an 
    amazing culture and I mean really can't beat it the 
    food is great service wonderful atmosphere captivating 
    I will definitely be eating here more often keep up
    the good hard work guys`,

  `The food was amazing and the service was wonderful. 
    It is a family-owned restaurant with nice decor and good ambience.
    We had the pleasure of meeting some of the family today 
    and they were so warm friendly, and hospitable. 
    We had such a great experience and will definitely
    come back. Highly recommend.`,

  `Fastest service for pho ever! We eat here a lot, 
    the eggrolls here tastes the best, and the pho 
    is great all around. Great noodles, generous 
    amounts of meats, and broth is always on point! 
    Also youll have to ask for chili oil and fish 
    sauce if you like it. The workers are nice and 
    friendly and the restaurant is always clean.`,

  `We were just passing through and stopped here. 
    The restaurant was very clean, the atmosphere was 
    peaceful and the service was very good. The women 
    working there are nice and attentive. We ordered B3 
    and it was amazing! Good quality food that hits the spot.`,

  `One of the BEST places I've ever been to. Waiters are super 
    nice and take the time to explain what's the best way 
    to eat/drink the dish/drink if it's your first time 
    having it. Everytime I went there with my partner it 
    never disappointed! It's always amazing, you can tell 
    the food is made with so much care and love.
    Everything I've had there is always super yummy! 
    Can't wait to go back there next time`,

  `Wow. A fantastic authentic Vietnamese experience that 
    you would never expect to find in Webb city. The 
    appetizers were all fresh and delicious and so reasonably 
    priced. The noodle broth in the pho had amazing flavor 
    and the meatballs were well seasoned. I will be back. 
    The place was packed on a Wednesday night with even a 
    small waiting list so it seems all the locals would agree 
    that this IS the place to get your Vietnamese fix.`,

  `The food is delicious the service is great. I've only
    been coming for a few weeks and they've memorized my 
    favorite order. I'm very particular about how my food 
    is prepared and find myself eating comfortably here. 
    This is my only 5 star review.`,
